    "description": "Hi! My name is Szymon and I have been dealing with frontend for 8 years.<br /><br />I have spent most of my professional life using the Angular framework (since version 2), but I believe that it is not the knowledge of a specific tool that is most important, but the ability to quickly acquire new knowledge.<br />That's why I didn't want to introduce myself as \"Angular developer\", \"React developer\" or \"[insert any library name here] developer\", but simply as <em>\"frontend developer\"</em > who can adapt to changing conditions.<br /><br />In the past, I had the opportunity to work in both small teams and large corporations, which allowed me to gain experience in many different areas. At work, I value above all the opportunity for continuous development, which is why I always try to look for new challenges and opportunities to learn.<br /><br />What I would like to bring to your team is, above all, a way of thinking that involves solving problems in the simplest and most effective way possible. I believe that you should choose the right tools for a specific problem, not the other way around. I don't like to complicate life, either for myself or for others, so I always try to choose solutions to accomplish the task set before me in the most optimal way.<br /><br />I am a conflict-free, calm person and always ready to help. I value teamwork because I believe that it is teamwork that allows me to achieve the best results. I believe that each of us has something to offer, which is why I always try to listen to others and learn from them.<br /><br />Outside of work, I am mainly interested in sports (especially tennis and football), and in my free time I also like to read a book or work in the garden."
